This method does basic stringifying of the @query param. If a value is not a string, it's stringified with JSON.stringify. Then, the string (no matter if it started as a string or not) is encoded with encodeURIComponent. This is because slack has a hard time understanding directly encoded 'objects' like {hello: 'world'}. Stringification before encoding works well enough. It's possible that this may cause some issues for some specific characters, but so far I have encountered none, even with emoji. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description method string The method to request. query object &lt;optional&gt; {} The query object to stringify.

Documentation coming soon, this is not a complete version. Feel free to clone the repo and run jsdoc, many classes are already pretty documented. This is is a complete rewrite of both frozor-slackbot and frozor-slack, combining their features and adding onto them for a much better overall library. I have no plans to include a guide to convert from either of those modules, mostly because nobody actually uses them to my knowledge but me. Currently, this lib supports the following slack APIs: Web API Real Time Messaging API (websocket) Current status: NOT READY TO USE More unit tests are needed to determine whether it works properly in all scenarios, and events are not yet extended with cached items. This is not production-ready. At some point I plan to add support for slash commands, interactive messages, and the events API, but having to run an express server inside this lib sounds like a mess I don't want to handle right now. I also plan to add some kind of client similar to the discordjs commando module, which just extends the Discord.Client. Right now, command handling can be a bit of a pain at times, even though frozor-commands actually makes it pretty simple for me. This client may have support for 'conversations' (prompts and user responses to those prompts), I don't really know yet. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-06-21T12:39:00-04:00 using the DocStrap template.

Methods &lt;static&gt; convertProperties(obj [, deep]) Converts slack properties into camelCase JS ones using a cloned object. This method does not take circular references into account since they should not exist in slack's responses. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description obj T The object to convert. deep boolean &lt;optional&gt; false Whether the conversion should be deep, i.e. if it should enter further objects to convert their properties. Returns: Type T Example // Returns {helloWorld: 'hi'} SlackUtil.convertProperties({ hello_world: 'hi!' }); &lt;static&gt; dateToSlack(date) Turns a Date into a slack timestamp (ms since epoch / 1000) Parameters: Name Type Description date Date The date to convert. Returns: Type number &lt;static&gt; getDate(slackTimestamp) Returns a Date converted from slack time (ms since epoch / 1000) Parameters: Name Type Description slackTimestamp number A unix epoch divided by 1000. Returns: Type Date &lt;static&gt; getNextCursor(res) Get the next cursor based on slack metadata.

Parameters: Name Type Description res object the slack response object to get a cursor for Returns: Type string | null &lt;static&gt; getNextPage(res, method, limit, getData) Get the next page of the request. Parameters: Name Type Description res object The last response from slack. method function The api function to call with the given limit and the next cursor. limit number The maximum number of results to return. getData function A function which accepts slack data and returns the data to add to the pages returned Returns: Type * &lt;async, static&gt; getPages(method [, args], getData [, pageLimit] [, singlePageLimit] [, combine]) Get all pages for a slack api call. This is useful for anything that requires the use of pagination, for instance the conversations.list method call. Pass arguments inside an object, so they are named. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description method function The api function to call. Pass a reference to the client.api.methods{your method} args object &lt;optional&gt; {} Arguments to use when calling this method for the first time (consecutive calls don't require args since the cursor stores it) getData function A function which accepts slack data and returns the data to add to the pages returned pageLimit number &lt;optional&gt; Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER The maximum number of pages to retrieve. This could result in a lot of calls if you're in a large organization. singlePageLimit number &lt;optional&gt; 100 The maximum number of results for one page. combine boolean &lt;optional&gt; true Whether or not to &quot;flatten&quot; all pages into a single array before returning them. If this is false, each array member will be a page of data, and if it is true all elements from each page will be in the same array level.
